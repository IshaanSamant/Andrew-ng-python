Summary
For the following program we have used polynomial regression to analyze the data.
We have chosen to work with only five factors to reduce computational power and make the model simpler.
First we import the dataset from a csv file and then store it in a data frame called data.
Using trial and error we have found the best combination of quadaratic and linear variable which gives us a low 
error but does not overfit our given dataset.

Explanation
First we traverse through our dataset(data), then we either just add the features, square them or multiply them with
another feature to another feature depending on our model.
In this case based on trial and error our combination of features for a row in a matrix is
[x1 x1^2 x1*x5 x2 x2*x4 x3 x4 x5 x5**2]
After creating of values that we want perform linear regression on it.

After performing linear regression on our data. We tried to reduce the value of the mean squared error that 
we get from the data plus the sum of sqaures of the coeffiecients, by reducing the value of this term we
ensure the proper balance between the bias and variance of our given model.

Finally we just take an input from the user and then we apply it to the model and get the probability of survival based 
on the input.
